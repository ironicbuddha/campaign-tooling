## What this campaign is
A high-magic feudal empire with rising guild power, unstable divine institutions, and liminal travel via the Fey Roads.

### Tone & themes
- wonder and dread
- political absurdity
- scarcity and trade
- secrets with consequences

### What characters might know
- Travel by sea is dangerous (three moons; monsters).
- Old-growth forests are protected; wood is scarce.
- Magic can be refined and traded like currency.

<!-- PRIVATE_START -->
## GM-only intent
- Core arc: faith crisis + guild leverage + intelligence war across borders.
- Keep “consensus time vs Fey time” as the metaphysical throughline.
- Session zero: establish lines/veils and table expectations.
