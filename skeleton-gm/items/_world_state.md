## World Snapshot
- Multi-species feudal empire, weak central authority, rising guild power.
- Magic is finite/refined; increasingly used as currency/collateral.
- Fey Roads enable liminal travel; time distortion; madness risk.
- Protected old-growth forests; treacherous sea (three moons); dangerous central wilds.
