## What the party knows (briefing version)
A remote monastery on the edge of the central wilds has gone silent. Caravans avoid the area. Crops nearby have failed. The Church is offering coin for answers, not miracles.

### Known facts
- The monastery was dedicated to an orthodox solar order.
- No official contact for several weeks.
- Locals report strange lights at night.

### Rumors
- The monks angered a forest spirit.
- The land itself is sick.
- Something crawls at night.

### Objective (as given)
Travel to the monastery, determine the cause of the blight, and report back.

## GM truth (what’s actually happening)
The blight originates from an improperly stored cache of refined magic hidden beneath the monastery, originally intended as collateral. A desperate attempt to “stabilize” the land triggered a cascading corruption that resonates with the Fey Roads.

### Antagonistic forces
- Mutated wildlife drawn to the magic
- A surviving monk partially phased in time
- A minor Fey entity feeding on distortion
